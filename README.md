# pii-data

This package provides base data structures for the management of PII i.e.
Personally Identifiable Information (it does *not* contain code for processing
documents, or extracting PII from documents).

For the full specification embodied by these base data structures, check the
[PIISA Data Specification].

## Data structures

Two main data types are defined to hold PII information: PII Entities and PII
Collections. There is also a Source Document data type.


### PII Source Document

A PII Source Document defines the raw data from which PII is detected. This
document is modeled as a number of chunks, each one having an identifier and a 
data contents (a raw text excerpt, or other types of content). This is managed
in this package by the [SrcDocument] class and subclasses.


### PII Collection

A PII Collection contains a list of detected/extracted PII Entities. Each
entity contains all the information needed to correctly identify one PII
instance and locate it in the document it belongs to.

These are the data classes defined:
 * `PiiCollection`: the full collection of PII
 * `PiiEntity`: one PII instance
 * `PiiDetector`: an object to describe the module used to generate a given
    `PiiEntity` object
	
`PiiCollection` objects have a `dump()` method that allows writing them in a
standard format, with two representations:
 * a JSON representation, adequate for storage
 * a NDJSON representation (newline-delimited JSON), intended for processing
   and streaming


## Online behaviour

There is partial support to use these data classes in an [streaming] fashion,
providing a way to feed data incrementally.
